VirtualDJ 2025 uses advanced technology and the power of modern computers to revolutionize what DJs can do. With this new version you can mix in real-time the various components of your tracks (vocals, instruments, kicks, hihats, etc). This opens the door to new ways of mixing that were simply not possible before, and will forever change the way DJs mix.

With real-time stem separation on any track, perfect live mashups and seamless transitions are now the new normal:

* ModernEQs can achieve a much more accurate separation than traditional frequency-based equalizers, and help achieve perfect transitions like never before.

* The new Stem pads will let you create live mash-ups and remixes in real-time easily. Let your creativity fly free.
